### Welcome to the iPSYCH community wiki!

This is wiki aims at gathering and building knowledge about best practices for genetic analyses, particularly of the iPSYCH data.

Learn more about iPSYCH there: https://ipsych.dk/en/.

Remember that this is a public space, make sure not to disclose any information that would breach ethics approvals of the data.

### How to contribute?

- Small (but useful!) contibutions: 

    - **opening an issue about some missing/unclear information**; whenever you have to search for some question or someone ask you a question about genetic analyses or/and iPSYCH data, please open an issue here to document that this piece of information is missing to this wiki
    
    - **participating in topic discussions** (in issues), e.g. mentioning missing information, useful references or external links
    
    - **clarifying a point in a wiki page** by adding a few sentences
    
    - **correcting typos**

- Larger contributions: 

    - **making wiki pages**
    
    - **reviewing wiki pages** (including code), by someone who is *not* expert in the corresponding topic


### Guidelines

- be nice with others and welcoming to new contributors

- always open a new issue when you think about missing information (it does *not* have to be you that add )

- each page should have is own corresponding issue

- split the issues and pages as much as possible, e.g. making a GWAS using PLINK and making a GWAS using BOLT are two different issues pages

- for complex analyses (all main ones basically), it would be good to work within teams (of e.g. two people)
