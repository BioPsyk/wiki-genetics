This wiki aims at gathering and building knowledge about best practices for genetic analyses, particularly of the iPSYCH data. Learn more about iPSYCH there: https://ipsych.dk/en/. Remember that this is a public space, make sure not to disclose any information that would breach ethics approvals of the data. How to contribute? Small (but useful!) contributions: opening an issue about some missing/unclear information; whenever you have to search for some question or someone ask you a question about genetic analyses or/and iPSYCH data, please open an issue here to document that this piece of information is missing to this wiki participating in topic discussions (in issues), e.g. mentioning missing information, useful references or external links clarifying a point in a wiki page by adding a few sentences correcting typos Larger contributions: making wiki pages reviewing wiki pages (including code), by someone who is not expert in the corresponding topic Guidelines be nice with others and welcoming to new contributors always open a new issue when you think about missing information (it does not have to be you that add the missing information afterwards) each page should have is own corresponding issue split the issues and pages as much as possible, e.g. making a GWAS using PLINK and making a GWAS using BOLT are two different issues and pages for complex analyses (all main ones basically), it would be good to work within teams (of e.g. two people) Contributing new pages At the beginning of each R Markdown file, we should have the following code block to include both chunk options and spelling check. ```{r setup, include=FALSE} # Global {knitr} options source(&quot;knitr-options.R&quot;) knitr::opts_chunk$set() # Spelling check WORDS_TO_IGNORE &lt;- c() source(&quot;spelling-check.R&quot;) ``` Each new page should go into its own new R Markdown file. The title of this new file should be an header (#) and sections should have header 2 (##). Include the (PART) section header only if this new page is the first one of a new part (collection of pages).
